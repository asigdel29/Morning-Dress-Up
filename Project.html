      <h1>Work Site for Computational Cognitive Modeling Project</h1>
      <p>This site represents work that Tyler West and Anubhav Sigdel have done in support of thier efforts to learn to model cognitive processes at SUNY Oswego during the Fall 2021 semester.As we have explored during class, we may hold beliefs which underpin our understanding of how the world works, and we may hold other beliefs which represent situations within the world. Our likelihood of accepting new information and using it to refine our beliefs can be based on experience, provenance, frequency, biases, and so forth. There are many strategies for inferring beliefs, whether it be from logical reasoning with a process for revision as in the AGM model, something like Johnson-Lairdâ€™s mental models, or any number of others.The materials will be temporally organized for the most part. Links to external sites that pertain to Prolog, CSNePS, modeling, Web development, and related matters will be placed after the personally created artifacts.

      <h2>Probelms Proposed</h2>
      <p>
      <b>Problem 1: Dungeon Crawler</b> <br/>
	<p>User navigates around a dungeon and can find treasure along the way. When the exit is found, the total amount of treasure found along the way is displayed.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Problem 2: Guess who</b> <br/>
      <p>At the beginning the user would be given options to choose from "famous personalities", Then as the user enters beliefs the program tries to guess the personality.The program would keep on trying to guess the person until the user agrees.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Problem 3: Oswego Fashion </b> <br/>
      <p>The game would be where the user defines term such as weather and the mood,and you are given options, the more beliefs you enter in the system , the lesser options you will get until you land on a single outfit. you cannot exit the game until you have "dressed".
